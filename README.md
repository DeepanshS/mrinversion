# Mrinversion

Mrinversion is a python package for inverting NMR signal. The package supports
inversion of two-dimension magic angle flipping (MAF) or any number of 2D spinning
sideband measurements coreelating the isotopic to the anisotropic frequencies, into
a three-dimensional
inverting the pure NMR anisotropic line-shape
into a distribution of the tensor
