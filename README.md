# Mrinversion

Mrinversion is a python package for inverting NMR signal. The package supports-

- inversion of decaying signal into a distribution of $T_2$ decay constants.
- inversion of signal recovery into a distribution of $T_1$ time constants.
- inversion of two-dimensional T1-T2 signal into a distribution of T1-T2 constants.
- inversion of two-dimension magic angle flipping (MAF)
inverting the pure NMR anisotropic line-shape
into a distribution of the tensor
